# `NRK-test` â€” task

This project is an Angularjs web app. 
The web page fetches a table from SSB through an api call and lists the data in a sortable table

## Getting Started

To get you started go to the terminal and run `npm start` from the folder where the project is copied to start the `$http server`.
Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`].
